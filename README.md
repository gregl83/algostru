### Naming Convention

A [cargo workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html) organizes algorithms and structures into a single project for convenience; however, publishing crates with a standard naming convention proves to be trickier due collisions in a single namespace. As such, a naming convention will be followed for each crate in this project using the prefix `g-algo`.

**Example:**

`g-algo-binary-search-tree`
